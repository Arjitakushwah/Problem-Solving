# Problem Solving

## question1
Given a array of size n. Answer q queries where you need to print the sum of values in a given range of indices for 1 to r(both inclusive).
NOTE: the values of 1 to r follow 1-base indexing

## question 2
Check if we can partition the array into two subarrays with equal sum. More formally, check thhe prefix sum of a part of the arrayis equal to the suffix sum of rest of the array.
 
## question 3
find the total number of pairs in the array whose sum is x(two sum problem)
--- using two loops(brute force appproach)

## question 4
(three sum problem)
--- using three loops(brute force approach)

## question 5
find the unique number in a given array where all the elements are repeated twice having one element unique

## question 6
second largest element in a given array
1st approach:
find maximum, replace maximum with min value, then again find maximum 


## question 7

given an array consist of integers. Return the first value that is repeating in this array. if no value is being repeated, reuturn -1.
Brute force approach: 
      using two for loops

## swaping
1. using temp variable
2. unsin sum and difference
a=a+b
b=a-b
a=a-b

## question 8
reverse an array consisting of integer values.
approach1:
      using travese array reversely and add in second array
